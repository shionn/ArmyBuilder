Each time a unit in this battalion is picked to fight, you can say that it
will go on a wizard hunt. If you do so, pick 1 melee weapon profile on
that unit's warscroll. Until the end of that phase, add I to the Attacks
characteristic of that melee weapon, but all of the attacks that unit
makes in that phase must target an enemy WiZARD.
Wizarps cannot be included in this battalion.

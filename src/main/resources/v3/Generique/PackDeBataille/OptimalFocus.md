At the start of the battle round, after priority is determined, the
player taking the second turn can pick 1 friendly **Hero** on the
battlefield. If that **Hero** is an **Andtorian Locus**, they can
attempt to cast 1 extra spell and attempt to unbind 1 extra spell
in that battle round. If they are not an **Andtorian Locus**, you
receive 1 command point that can only be spent to allow that
**Hero** to issue a command.

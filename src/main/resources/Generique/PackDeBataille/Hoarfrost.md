Hoarfrost is a spell that has a casting value of 8 and a range of
12", If successfully cast, pick 1 friendly unit wholly within range
and visible to the caster. Pick 1 melee weapon profile on that
unitâ€™s warscroll and roll a D3. Change the To Hit, To Wound or
Rend characteristic of that melee weapon to match the result
until the start of your next hero phase. For example, if the result
was 2, you could change either the To Hit characteristic to 2+,
the To Wound characteristic to 2+ or the Rend characteristic
to -2.
